# Isodar and Isolegs

Isodar and Immigration/Emigration code by S. Carran 

Isoleg code by M. Malone. This code is for conducting isoleg analyses in Polivka et al. 2024.
When conducting an isoleg analysis on activity densities observed in the wild one should first (as always) conduct exploratory analyses.
Exploratory analysis should indicate if there are paired habitats organisms can select between.
In our case, this meant analyzing treated habitats, paired as deep and shallow.
We used the median pool depth for that year as the cut off between deep and shallow habitat categorization.
Only 2014 and 2015 surveys allowed for paired comparisons between deep and shallow activity densities.
