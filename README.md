# isolegs

#this code is for conducting isoleg analyses in Polivka et al. 2024
#When conducting an isoleg analysis on activity densities observed in the wild one should first (as always) conduct exploratory analyses
#Exploratory analysis should indicate if there are paired habitats organisms can select between
#in our case (Polivka et al. 2024) this meant analyzing treated habitats, paired as deep and shallow
#We used the median pool depth for that year as the cut off between deep and shallow habitat categorization
#only 2014 and 2015 surveys allowed for paired comparisons between deep and shallow activity densities
